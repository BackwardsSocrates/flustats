# ABSTRACT
Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that is present in four types; A,B,C and D. In this project our area of interest is the State of California, where we will observe various factors that may or may not influence risk of spread such as but not limited to; region, availability of healthcare, vaccination success rates for a given year, population density of humans and insects (e.g. mosquitoes), socio-economic status, education level, season etc. By determining the most influencial factors, possible solutions may be constructed to combat spread. We also want to predict future spread patterns for upcoming flu season.
